    subtitle: An easy way to evaluate the tool without any setup required
    description: |- 
      We recommend starting using this method. Start by downloading the provided virtual machine. You shouldn't need it but just incase the virtual machines password is **'artifact'**. The virtual machine will allow you to view the raw data, reproduce our results from our raw data and generate your own tests. We recommend importing the virtual machine into [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org). Once you have downloaded and setup the virtual machine, go to the  [Raw Data](./raw-data/) tab.

  - title: Entire Tool
    subtitle: To get the entire tool requires powerful machine and setting up many complex dependencies
    description: |- 
      If you want to simulate the drones flying the tests, you will need to install complex dependencies described in the [Tool Pipeline](./setup/) section. For the second case we recommend cloning the repository which contains the raw data, data processing scripts and entire tool pipeline. To clone the repository you can run:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/hildebrandt-carl/RobotTestGeneration.git
      ```
